Issue Description

The submission did not include all the required information for apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions.

The following information needs to be included in the App Store metadata:

Resources

Apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions must include all of the following required information in the app itself:

- Title of auto-renewing subscription (this may be the same as the in-app purchase product name)
- Length of subscription
- Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate
- Functional links to the privacy policy and Terms of Use (EULA)

The app metadata must also include functional links to the privacy policy in the Privacy Policy field in App Store Connect and the Terms of Use (EULA) in the App Description or EULA field in App Store Connect.

Guideline 3.1.2 - Business - Payments - Subscriptions

One or more auto-renewable subscriptions are marketed in the purchase flow in a way that may mislead or confuse users about the subscription terms or pricing. Specifically:

- The auto-renewable subscription promotes the free trial, introductory pricing, or introductory period for the subscription more clearly and conspicuously than the billed amount.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, it would be appropriate to:

- Revise the auto-renewable subscription purchase flow to clearly indicate how long the free trial lasts and the amount that will be billed after the free trial is over.
